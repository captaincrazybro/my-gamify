# My Gamify
My Gamify is an Amazon Alexa skill that was designed to bring more engagement to the classroom.
It constists of a simple but fun quiz system that lets students join the session on their phones through the Alexa app.
The application also comes with a UI to help manage the rooms, see a leaderboard, and manage questions.
